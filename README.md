## Overview
Chest radiographs (x-rays or CXR) are the most common diagnostic imaging test in medicine. Radiographs are intended to address a specific clinical question (e.g. rule out pneumonia), and most are considered "normal." We hypothesized that normal radiographs also contain "hidden" information about health and longevity that can be extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 

The result is CXR-Risk, a CNN that predicts the risk of 12-year all-cause mortality based on a chest radiograph image. Persons in the highest CXR-risk category had a 53% 12-year mortality rate, 18-fold higher than the lowest risk. Prognostic value was independent of the radiologists' diagnostic findings (e.g. lung nodule) and standard risk factors (e.g. age, sex, diabetes). Please refer to the [JAMA Open manuscript](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2738349) for details.

## Datasets
PLCO (NCT00047385) data used for model development and testing are available from the National Cancer Institute (NCI, https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/plco/). NLST (NCT01696968) testing data is available from the NCI (https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/nlst/) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN, https://www.acrin.org/acrin-nlstbiorepository.aspx). Due to the terms of our data use agreement, I cannot distribute the original data. Please instead obtain the data directly from the NCI and ACRIN.

The `data` folder provides the image filenames, split of PLCO into independent training/tuning/testing datasets, and the CXR-Risk output probabilities:
* `PLCO_dataset_split.csv` describes the split of the chest radiographs into training, tuning, and testing datasets. filenamepng refers to the original TIF filename converted to a PNG. "dataset" is 1 for training, 2 for tuning, and 3 for testing. 
* `PLCO_probs.csv` contains the probabilities (cxr-risk_prob) generated by CXR-risk in the PLCO testing dataset. Probabilities were put into ordinal categories (cxr-risk_cat), with 1 corresponding to very low risk and 5 corresponding to very high risk as described in the manuscript.
* `NLST_probs.csv` contains the probabilities (cxr-risk_prob) and ordinal probability categories (cxr-risk_cat) for the NLST testing dataset. The format for filenamepng is the (original participant directory)_(original DCM filename).png


## Image processing
PLCO radiographs were provided as scanned TIF files by the NCI. TIFs were converted to PNGs with a maximum dimension of 512 pixels with ImageMagick v6.8.9-9. 

Many of the PLCO radiographs were rotated 90 or more degrees. To address this, we developed a CNN to identify rotated radiographs. First, we trained a CNN using the resnet34 architecture to identify synthetically rotated radiographs from the [CXR14 dataset](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Wang_ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). We then fine tuned this CNN using 11,000 manually reviewed PLCO radiographs. The rotated radiographs identified by this CNN in `preprocessing/plco_rotation_github.csv` were then corrected using ImageMagick. 

```bash
cd path_for_PLCO_tifs
mogrify -path destination_for_PLCO_pngs -trim +repage -colorspace RGB -auto-level -depth 8 -resize 512x512^ -format png "*.tif"
cd path_for_PLCO_pngs
while IFS=, read -ra cols; do mogrify -rotate 90 "${cols[0]}"; done < /path_to_repo/preprocessing/plco_rotation_github.csv
```

NLST radiographs were provided as DCM files by ACRIN. We chose to first convert them to TIF using DCMTK v3.6.1, then to PNGs with a maximum dimension of 512 pixels through ImageMagick to maintain consistency with the PLCO radiographs:

```bash
cd path_to_NLST_dcm
for x in *.dcm; do dcmj2pnm -O +ot +G $x "${x%.dcm}".tif; done;
mogrify -path destination_for_NLST_pngs -trim +repage -colorspace RGB -auto-level -depth 8 -resize 512x512^ -format png "*.tif"
```


The orientation of several NLST chest radiographs was manually corrected:

```
cd destination_for_NLST_pngs
mogrify -rotate "90" -flop 204025_CR_2000-01-01_135015_CHEST_CHEST_n1__00000_1.3.51.5146.1829.20030903.1123713.1.png
